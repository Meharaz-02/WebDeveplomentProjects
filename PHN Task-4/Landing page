            <h3>Managing a Community</h3>
            <p>Manage Community Actively: An efficient community manager can make all the difference. Active administration and moderation keeps abuse, spam, neglect, inactivity, and poor behavior of the participants away. 
                A smart way to do this would be to get a good community manager. Community manager helps build relationships, gives the company a voice, creates buzz, listens to the chatter, and figures out the trends and concerns.
                 He passes uses the data gathered from insights to help build better processes for the organization and improve the community.</p>

            <h3>Building a Community</h3>
            <p>    Choose The Platform Wisely: There are multiple community development platforms available to build communities. However, it can be hard to decide the best. Each has its own uses and serves a niche. Nevertheless, which one suits you, you can decide after factoring in some important points like:

                Platform stability
                Scalability
                Flexibility and customization
                Mobile Capabilities
                License Fee
                Development Cost
                Setup and deployment time
                Out of box plugins
                Support and Maintenance

                <h3>Community and community-led growth becomes core to more businesses</h3>
                <p>The pandemic was a slingshot for a community model within businesses and organisations. In 2022 we saw many more businesses and organisations calling themselves “community-centric organisations” or stating their focus was “community-led growth.”

                    In 2023 more companies will dedicate attention and resources towards building year-round communities for multiple stakeholders.
                    
                    There will be an increasing recognition that communities are valuable, tangible business assets - an important element of a strong brand and an economic ‘moat’.
                    
                    The 2022 State of Community Management report from The Community Roundtable highlighted that 88% of C-level execs felt positive towards community programs compared to 56% in 2017.
                    
                    This report and the CMX 2022 Community Industry Report highlighted an increase in independent community departments, but also an increased shift towards community being a part of the marketing function.</p>

                <h3>Community Based Marketing (CBM) gathers pace</h3>
                <p>Investment in community for building awareness/brand salience, creating mental availability and generating data and insights has gained real momentum in 2022.

                    In 2020, Ashley Friedlein and I coined the term Community Based Marketing (CBM) and defined this new, professionalised marketing discipline. We also explained who was doing it well and the success factors behind it.
                    
                    Many marketers are practising ABM (Account Based Marketing) in B2B marketing, but CBM (Community Based Marketing ) hadn’t been truly defined or professionalised before 2020.
                    
                    Here is the definition of Community Based Marketing (CBM):
                    
                    "Community Based Marketing (CBM) is bringing people together around a shared practice, purpose, place, product or set of circumstances to create insights and closer, more valuable relationships with prospects, customers and other stakeholders to deliver organisational value."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Community aligns closer to influencer marketing and employee advocacy</h3>
                <p>Social Selling, Employee Advocacy and supporting SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) to influence through social media are mature disciplines in B2B.

                    At the B2B Social Trailblazers Summit, Influencer Marketing specialists from IBM, Ericsson, Mercer and agencies as well as creators/influencers including Sally Eaves, Neal Shaffer, Bernard Marr, Ronald van Loon and Efi Pylarinou talked about best practice and trends in the influencer and employee advocacy space.
                    
                    We were shown influencer partnerships, campaigns and business outcomes that would impress most consumer marketers.
                    
                    But one of the key realisations from the summit was that by focusing on social media for the past decade, the power of engaging with or creating smaller, influential communities and networks may have been overlooked.
                    
                    We can expect smart B2B strategists who presented at the conference like Katy Howell, Danielle Guzman and Anita Veszili to lead the charge and align influencer, employee advocacy and Community Based Marketing (CBM) with social media and influencer marketing programs and tools. They will use community to signal and deliver influence and impact.
                    
                    “The rise of the B2B influencer is likely to also have an impact within Community Based Marketing.
                    
                    This is a hot topic right now across social, and it makes sense that community would be part of the trend.”
                    
                    Katy Howell - CEO - Immediate Future
                    
                    
                    “More than ever, we're seeing CEOs become celebrities online.
                    
                    Not only that, we're seeing investors, product managers, designers, recruiters become celebrities online too.
                    
                    This is by far one of the best things I'm seeing as it gives a lot of perspective into a company or an individual's approach to things, but also builds the element of trust and strengthens relationships with companies.”
                    
                    Edu Giansante – Head of Community - Wix
                    
                    
                    “In the past, the worlds of community and social media were quite distinct.
                    
                    As communities become more about prospect and customer engagement, or lead generation, we will see social media and community working closer together.
                    
                    Likewise, the relatively more recent emergence of influencer marketing as a discipline clearly interrelates with communities of influence.”</p>
